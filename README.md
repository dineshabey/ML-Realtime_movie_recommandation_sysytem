## ü§ñ ML- Realtime movie recomendation system

#Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a prototype of a real-time recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. The system should dynamically adjust its recommendations based on user interactions. This project aims to assess skills in data processing, model deployment, handling streaming data, and integrating machine learning models into a real-world application.

#Dataset

The MovieLens dataset includes user ratings for movies, movie metadata, and user demographic information. This dataset will be used for movie recommendations, with the system adapting its recommendations in real-time based on user interactions.

#Tasks

#Data Preparation and Analysis

Conduct exploratory analysis to understand the dataset's structure, content, and potential challenges.
Preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and ensuring it's suitable for streaming.

#Recommendation Model Development

Implement a recommendation model using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach.
Consider advanced techniques like matrix factorization (e.g., SVD, ALS) or deep learning models (e.g., neural collaborative filtering).
Real-Time Interaction Simulation

Simulate real-time user interactions with the system.
Implement a method to update the recommendation model in real-time or near-real-time without retraining from scratch.

#Evaluation and Testing

Develop a method to evaluate the performance of the recommendation system in real-time.
Test the system with simulated user interaction data to assess its adaptability and performance.

#System Design and Implementation

Provide a high-level design of the recommendation system, including data ingestion, processing, model updating, and recommendation delivery mechanisms.
Discuss how the system can be scaled to handle a large number of users and items.

#Deliverables

Detailed Jupyter notebook or a set of Python scripts with code, outputs, and explanations for all tasks.
README.md file describing the project, its objectives, dataset, tasks, and how to run the code.

#Evaluation Criteria

Complexity and Scalability: Ability to handle complex data and scale the solution.

Real-Time Processing: Efficiency in processing and adapting to real-time data.

Model Performance: Effectiveness of the recommendation model and its adaptability to new data.

System Design: Clarity and scalability of the system architecture.

Innovativeness: Creativity in the approach, especially in model development and system integration.

#Conclusion

This project aims to develop a real-time movie recommendation system that can adapt its recommendations based on user interactions. It involves data processing, model development, real-time interaction simulation, evaluation, and system design. The outcome will be a prototype system that demonstrates the ability to provide personalized movie recommendations in real-time.

#Technologies Used

Python: Programming language used for the backend logic.

## üöÄ Running the Real-Time Movie Recommendation System 

- To run the real-time movie recommendation system, follow these steps:

#Download Dataset:

Download the MovieLens 20M dataset from Kaggle.
Extract the downloaded file and locate the movie.csv and ranking.csv files.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset

#Prepare Environment:

Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
Place the movie.csv and ranking.csv files in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook file.

#Run the Notebook:

Open your Jupyter Notebook environment.
Open the realtime_movie_recommendation.ipynb file.
Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code.

#Follow Notebook Instructions:

The notebook will guide you through data preprocessing, model development, real-time interaction simulation, and evaluation.
Ensure you follow the instructions in the notebook for each step.

#Evaluate Results:

Once the notebook finishes running, evaluate the results and performance of the real-time recommendation system.

#Optional: Modify Code:

Feel free to modify the code in the notebook to experiment with different models, algorithms, or parameters.

#Documentation:

The notebook includes explanations and comments to help you understand each step of the process.
By following these steps, you can run the real-time movie recommendation system using the MovieLens 20M dataset and evaluate its performance in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
